Creating a sponsored post for Instagram typically involves interacting with Instagram's proprietary API, and as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Instagram's API doesn't provide open access for creating sponsored posts. Instagram's advertising and promotional features are primarily managed through the Facebook Ads platform.

However, for general post scheduling and management on Instagram (both organic and sponsored), you can consider using open-source or third-party tools that work with Instagram. These tools are designed to help you schedule and manage posts, including sponsored content. Some open-source and third-party options to explore include:

1. **Instauto**: Instauto is an open-source Python library that allows you to automate various Instagram actions, including posting images and videos. While it's not specifically designed for sponsored posts, you can use it for scheduling.

2. **Instapy**: Instapy is another Python library for automating Instagram actions. It provides features for posting images, captions, and more. Keep in mind that using automation tools on Instagram comes with certain risks and may not be allowed by Instagram's terms of service.

3. **Buffer (Limited Free Version)**: Buffer is a popular social media management platform that offers limited free access. It allows you to schedule and manage posts for Instagram, including sponsored content.

4. **Later (Free Plan)**: Later offers a free plan with basic features for scheduling Instagram posts. While it may not specifically cater to sponsored posts, it can help schedule and manage your content.

5. **Planoly (Free Plan)**: Planoly is another tool with a free plan for Instagram post scheduling. It also offers analytics and planning features.

Please note that while these tools may help schedule and manage your posts, the actual creation and management of sponsored content often require coordination with Instagram's advertising platform, including budget allocation, targeting, and performance tracking. Sponsored posts often involve paid promotions, which can only be accomplished through Instagram's advertising system.

Always check the latest terms of service and policies for Instagram, as they can change, and ensure you comply with Instagram's rules and guidelines, especially when using third-party tools. Additionally, keep in mind that new tools may have emerged since my last knowledge update, so it's a good idea to explore the latest options available.
