As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Instagram doesn't provide a public API for creating sponsored posts directly. Instagram's advertising platform is primarily managed through Facebook Ads Manager. To create sponsored posts and run advertising campaigns on Instagram, you typically use the Facebook Ads API and related tools. However, these are primarily used by advertisers and agencies to manage advertising campaigns, and they don't allow for direct organic posting.

If you're looking to schedule and automate organic posts to Instagram, you can consider using third-party social media management tools or scheduling platforms that have integrated with Instagram's API. These tools can help you plan and schedule posts, including sponsored content, in advance. Some popular social media management platforms that may support Instagram scheduling include Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout Social, Later, and Planoly. Keep in mind that the capabilities and integrations of these tools may change over time, so it's essential to check their current offerings and Instagram's policies.

Please note that Instagram's policies and API access can change, and the ability to schedule sponsored posts or use third-party tools may have evolved since my last update. Always check Instagram's official developer documentation and the policies of any third-party tools you plan to use to ensure compliance with the latest guidelines and regulations.
